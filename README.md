Hi!

My name is Nancy Okeke, a Junior at UCLA majoring in Cognitive Science, minoring in Data Science, and specializing in Computing. With a strong foundation in technology, psychology, and recently business, I have developed a passion for PM/TPM. My unique interdisciplinary background equips me with hands-on experience in web development, UX/UI design, and AI/ML that could aid in my career in PM/TPM! I'm eager to apply ALL of my skills in a groundbreaking environment and contribute to exciting and innovative projects.

ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Student-College Matching.
Check out my work on this AI project for Resolvely! My team and I developed a sophisticated AI model that assesses a high school studentâ€™s preferred list of colleges based on their interests, preferences, and high school progress.


What We Did: Cleaned and merged various CSV datasets regarding various institutions, scholarships, college graduation rates, etc, employing one-hot encoding preprocessing and machine learning techniques such as K-Means Algorithm and Hyperparameter Tuning to predict student matching accuracy.
Results: Predicted earnings after college with high accuracy (RÂ² = 0.88). The model is effective at predicting earning outcomes, which can inform students about the financial benefits of attending different institutions.
